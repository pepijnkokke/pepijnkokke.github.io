                  restrictive, intersective, and appositive
                  modification. The model contains a formally defined
                  interpreted lexicon, which specifies the inventory
                  of symbols and the supported semantic operators, and
                  an informally defined annotation scheme that
                  instructs annotators in which way to bind words and

                  hypothesis to the interpreted lexicon. We explore
                  the applicability of the proposed model to the

                  based the manual annotation work. The constructions
                  we annotated were found to occur in 80.65\% of the
                  entailments in RTE 1–4 and were annotated with
                  cross-annotator agreement of 68\% on average. The

  abstract  = {In recent years, the interest in using proof
                  assistants to formalise and reason about mathematics
                  and programming languages has grown. Type-logical
                  grammars, being closely related to type theories and
                  systems used in functional programming, are a
                  perfect candidate to next apply this curiosity
                  to. The advantages of using proof assistants is that
                  they allow one to write formally verified proofs
                  about one’s type-logical systems, and that any
                  theory, once implemented, can immediately be
                  computed with. The downside is that in many cases
                  the formal proofs are written as an afterthought,
                  are incomplete, or use obtuse syntax. This makes it
                  that the verified proofs are often much more
                  difficult to read than the pen-and-paper proofs, and
                  almost never directly published. In this paper, we
                  will try to remedy that by example. Concretely, we
                  use Agda to model the Lambek-Grishin calculus, a
                  grammar logic with a rich vocabulary of typeforming
                  operations. We then present a verified procedure for
                  cut elimination in this system. Then we briefly
                  outline a continuation-passing style translation
                  from proofs in the Lambek-Grishin calculus to
                  programs in Agda. And finally, we will put our
                  system to use in the analysis of a simple example
                  sentence. },

  abstract  = {As proofs in type theory become increasingly
                  complex, there is a growing need to provide better
                  proof automation. This paper shows how to implement
                  a Prolog-style resolution procedure in the
                  dependently typed programming language
                  Agda. Connecting this resolution procedure to Agda’s
                  reflection mechanism provides a first-class proof
                  search tactic for first-order Agda terms. As a
                  result, writing proof automation tactics need not be
                  different from writing any other program. },

                  inferential phenomena in entailment data, buttressed
                  by a formal semantic model and a proof-system that
                  provide immediate verification of the coherency and
                  completeness of the marked annotations. By
                  integrating a web-based user interface, a formal
                  lexicon, a lambda-calculus engine and an
                  off-the-shelf theorem prover, the platform allows
                  human annotators to mark linguistic phenomena in
                  entailment data (pairs made up of a premise and a
                  hypothesis) and to receive immediate feedback
                  whether their annotations are substantiated: for
                  positive entailment pairs, the system searches for a
                  formal logical proof that the hypothesis follows
                  from the premise; for negative pairs, the system
                  verifies that a counter-model can be
                  constructed. This novel approach facilitates the
                  creation of textual entailment corpora with
                  annotations that are sufficiently coherent and
                  complete for recognizing the entailment relation or
                  lack thereof. A corpus of several hundred annotated
                  entailments is currently being compiled based on the
                  platform and will be available for the research
                  community in the foreseeable future. },
